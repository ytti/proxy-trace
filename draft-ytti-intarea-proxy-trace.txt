                   draft-ytti-intarea-proxy-trace-00

Abstract

   This document describes a network diagnostic tool called Proxy Trace.
   Proxy Trace has similarities with PING and TRACEROUTE in that it uses
   PING style ICMP request to ask the remote host to trigger a single
   packet TRACEROUTE query and deliver the reply in PING style ICMP
   reply.

1.  Introduction

   Network operators use TRACEROUTE to discover the path between the
   client host and a target host.  An Operator does this by running the
   traceroute software on the client host and giving as an argument
   target host to which operator wants to discover the network path.
   This information helps network operator to understand and
   troubleshoot issues on the network.

   This document describes a network diagnostic tool called Proxy Trace.
   Proxy Trace is similar to TRACEROUTE in that it can be used to
   discover path between two hosts, but it differs from TRACEROUTE in
   that it can discover the path between two arbitrary hosts, allowing
   operator not only discover the reverse path but also removes the
   requirement that the operator must have access to a host in the path.

   Further unlike alternative solutions such as looking glasses, Proxy
   Trace replies are formal and machine parseable.  This enables
   programmatic discovery of both directions of the path.  Motivation
   for Proxy Trace is to reduce outage times by reducing the time it
   takes to identify the issue, while also enabling programmatic
   identification and recovery of an outage.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

   Proxy Trace Request:  An ICMP packet Proxy Trace Client sends to a
      Proxy Trace Server.

   Proxy Trace Reply:  An ICMP packet Proxy Trace Server sends to a
      Proxy Trace Client.

   Proxy Trace Client:  Client host requesting for a Proxy Trace

   Proxy Trace Server:  Server listening to a Proxy Trace Requests,
      sending Proxy Trace Probe Request, receiving Proxy Trace Probe
      Reply and sending Proxy Trace Reply

   Proxy Trace Target:  Destination address of the Proxy Trace Probe
      Request

   Proxy Trace Probe Request:  Packet Proxy Trace Server sends towards
      the Proxy Trace Target.  Equivalent to the packet generated by
      TRACEROUTE

   Proxy Trace Probe Reply:  Packet received from the network as a reply
      to the Proxy Trace Probe Request, usually ICMP TTL Exceeded or
      ICMP Host Unreachable message

                                 Figure 1

   In the attached diagram PT Client wants to discover the path from PT
   Server to a PT Target.  The same process is repeated for each Hop:

   Send Proxy Trace Request:  PT Client sends Proxy Trace Request to PT
      Server with Hop-Limit '1' and Destination Address 'PT Target'.

   Receive Proxy Trace Request:  PT Server receives Proxy Trace Request,
      verifies its size and TLVs.

   Send Proxy Trace Probe Request:  PT Server sends Proxy Trace Probe
      Request towards PT Target out from the Interface where FIB informs
      PT Target to be located.  PT Server SHOULD use the same FIB for
      Proxy Trace Probe Request as where it received the Proxy Trace
      Request.

   Receive Proxy Trace Probe Request:  Hop1 received the Proxy Trace
      Probe Request, because TTL has expired it punts the packet from
      data-plane to control-plane.

   Send Proxy Trace Probe Reply:  Hop1 sends ICMP TTL Exceeded message
      to the PT Server

   Receive Proxy Trace Probe Reply:  PT Server received the Proxy Trace
      Probe Reply and relates it to the open Proxy Trace Request.

   Send Proxy Trace Reply:  PT Server generates Proxy Trace Reply
      message and adds Proxy Trace Probe Reply packet as TLV 0 to the
      Proxy Trace Reply message.  PT Server sends the Proxy Trace Reply
      message to the PT Client.

   Receive Proxy Trace Reply:  PT Client receives the Proxy Trace Reply
      from PT Server learning that Hop Limit 1 in the path between PT
      Server and PT Target it Hop1

   PT Client is free to send multiple Proxy Trace Request messages
   without waiting for a Proxy Trace Reply message.

4.  ICMP Proxy Trace Request

   The ICMP Proxy Trace Request is defined for both ICMPv4 and ICMPv6.
   Like any ICMP message, the ICMP Proxy Trace Request is encapsulated
   in an IP header.  The ICMPv4 version of the ICMP Proxy Trace Request
   message is encapsulated in an IPv4 header, while the ICMPv6 version
   is encapsulated in an IPv6 header.  ICMP Proxy Trace Request
   message's minimum size on IPv4 level is 576B and on IPv6 level 1280B.

   Figure 2. depicts the ICMP Proxy Trace Request message.

   Proxy Trace Probe Request Payload Fields:

   Timestamp:  6B timestamp, as documented in the TIMESTAMP section
   Identifier:  2B Identifier from the Proxy Trace Request Message
   Sequence Number:  2B Sequence Number from the Proxy Trace Request
      Message
   Payload Hash:  4B hash of the Proxy Trace Probe Request Payload
      Fields + Local Secret
   Source Address  4B or 16B Source Address from the Proxy Trace Request

7.  Stateless Operation

   Implementation MAY choose to do an entirely stateless Proxy Trace
   Server implementation.  The benefit of stateless implementation is
   that it is friendly towards implementation in the hardware.
   Stateless implementation MUST use Payload Hash to verify Proxy Trace
   Probe Request for correctness, otherwise an unsolicited Proxy Trace
   Probe Request message may create 52B amplification, with hash
   verification there is 1:4294967296 attenuation for the unsolicited
   Proxy Trace Probe Request messages.  Implication of stateless
   operation is that the Proxy Trace Probe Reply message must contain
   the original Proxy Trace Probe Request up-to the Source Address,
   otherwise payload hash verification will fail.  This further implies
   that for IPv4 the host sending the Proxy Trace Probe Reply message
   needs to support [RFC4884] for stateless operation to function.
   Proxy Trace Server using stateless operation has no obligation to
   function when Proxy Trace Probe Reply message does not facilitate
   stateless operation, more specifically there is no requirement for
   stateful operation as a fallback.

8.  Timestamp format

   The timestamp should be 6 bytes or 48 bits wide, most significant bit
   is a flag called 'non-canonical epoch'.  If 'non-canonical epoch'
   flag is not set timestamp's epoch is UTC midnight, if 'non-canonical
   epoch' flag is set then epoch is unspecified but not UTC midnight.
   Timestamp unit is nanoseconds.

9.  ICMP Message Processing

   When a host receives an ICMP Proxy Trace Request message and any of
   the following conditions apply, the node MUST silently discard the
   incoming message:

   o  The node does not recognize ICMP Proxy Trace Request messages.
   o  The node has disabled the ICMP Proxy Trace Request functionality.
   o  The incoming ICMP Proxy Trace Request message is too small.
   o  The Source Address of the incoming message is not a unicast
      address.
   o  The Destination Address of the incoming message is a multicast
      address.

   Discard SHOULD happen in the forwarding-plane

   Otherwise, when a node receives an ICMPv4 Proxy Trace Request, it
   MUST format an ICMPv4 Proxy Trace Reply as follows:

   Don't Fragment (DF) flag:  1
   More Fragments flag:  0
   Fragment Offset:  0
   TTL:  255
   Protocol:  ICMP

   When a node receives an ICMPv6 Proxy Trace Request, it MUST format an
   ICMPv6 Proxy Trace Reply as follows:

   Hop Limit:  255
   Next Header:  ICMPv6

   In either case, the responding node MUST do the following:

   o  Copy the Source Address from the Proxy Trace Request message to
      the Destination Address of the Proxy Trace Reply message.
   o  Copy the Destination Address from the Proxy Trace Request message
      to the Source Address of the Proxy Trace Reply message.
   o  Set the ICMP Type to Proxy Trace Reply.
   o  Copy the Identifier from the Proxy Trace Request message to the
      Proxy Trace Reply message.

   o  Copy the Sequence Number from the Proxy Trace Request message to
      the Proxy Trace Reply message.
   o  Set the Code field to 0.
   o  Set the Checksum appropriately.
   o  Set the TLVs appropriately.
   o  Forward the Proxy Trace Reply to the Proxy Trace Client.

10.  Implementation Considerations

   A host implementing Proxy Trace SHOULD have it turned on by default
   in all interfaces and MUST allow turning it off/on per interface.
   The implementation MUST police rate of received Proxy Trace Request
   messages at the data-plane to 1000 pps, implementation SHOULD allow
   policer to be configured.

   Proxy Trace Server SHOULD timeout after 1 second of waiting for a
   Proxy Trace Probe Reply message and MAY timeout earlier.  Proxy Trace
   Server SHOULD NOT send Proxy Trace Reply message if it timed out.

11.  Error Handling

   Proxy Trace Server encountering any problem in the Proxy Trace
   Request message MUST not send any Proxy Trace Probe Reqeust message
   out and SHOULD send Proxy Trace Reply message to the Proxy Trace
   Client informing of the issue.  Proxy Trace Server may give up
   parsing the Proxy Trace Request message after one or more problems.

   Proxy Trace Server receiving too small Proxy Trace Request message
   should silently discard it in the data-plane.

12.  IANA Considerations

   Per this document, IANA is requested to reference this document in
   the "Internet Control Message Control (ICMP) Parameters" and the
   "Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) Parameters"
   registries under the "Code Fields" group.

13.  Security Considerations

   Allowing the client to set arbitrary Payload will create
   amplification potential.

   Allowing the client to define Protocol, Port and Bit Pattern allows
   client to craft arbitrary packets enabling it to perform port
   knocking and trigger packet-of-death bugs.

   Opt-In Request TLVs should only be honored in trusted networks.

   By default, unlike ICMP Echo, there is bps attenuation because the
   Proxy Request messages are much larger than the Proxy Trace Probe
   Request and the Proxy Trace Probe Reply messages.

   By default there is potentially 2 x pps amplification, however this
   is a minor concern as other more common vectors, such as TCP SYN
   spoofing allow for much higher pps amplification.

   There is no way for the Client to cause the Server to send more than
   two packets per each packet the Client sends.

   Other than gleaning information about UDP TRACEROUTE ports, there are
   no security implications identified in setting the destination
   address TLV.  Attacker setting the destination address TLV will
   necessarily create less traffic towards the victim compared to not
   setting the destination address TLV and spoofing the source address.
   Without setting the destination address TLV Attacker will be able to
   send two packets to a single Victim, whereas by setting the
   destination address TLV Attacker can only send one packet per victim.

   Precedent exists in [RFC8335] where we can ask the server to return
   information to us which would normally not be visible to us.  Like
   every packet received on control-plane there are always risks
   involved in software defects, however we need to balance the cost of
   those risks with the cost savings afforded by diagnostic tools due to
   reduced outage times.  Historically we have had security issues in
   ICMP Echo, including f00fc7c8 and +++ATH, but we continue to utilize
   ICMP Echo because the perceived diagnostic value in reducing outage
   times exceeds the perceived risk carried.
